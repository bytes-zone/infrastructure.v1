{"body":"\n# elm-conf 2020 is cancelled\n\nAs of June 7, elm-conf 2020 is cancelled.\nIf you previously registered, you'll receive an email with details about refunds (but as a summary: we'll be refunding your ticket in full.)\n\nMany factors went into this decision, but the most important is this: over the past few days, each member of the elm-conf team independently needed to step back from organizing.\nWith a reduced organizer capacity, I can longer put on the event this year.\nI know that many of you will be disappointedâ€”I am too, but I think it's the right choice given what's happening in the world right now.\n\nThanks,  \nBrian Hicks, lead organizer, elm-conf\n","staticData":{}}
