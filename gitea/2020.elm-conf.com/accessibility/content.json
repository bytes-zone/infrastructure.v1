{"body":"\n# Accessibility at elm-conf\n\nWe want everyone to be able to attend and enjoy elm-conf.\nBecause of that, we'll be doing a couple things:\n\n1. **The entire event will be online.**\n   You don't need anything but a computer and internet connection to attend elm-conf 2020.\n   If something is too loud or quiet, you don't have to ask the venue or event staff; you can do it yourself.\n   We will make recordings available as soon as possible, so that if you miss something you can go back and catch up.\n\n2. **All talks will have a live transcription.**\n   We will also use this as the basis for subtitles in published recordings.\n\nTo address the elephant in the room: why haven't we done these things before?\nPut simply, we haven't had toâ€”we acknowledge that there are people who couldn't come to St. Louis in person for the event, and while we tried to make the physical space as accessible as possible there will always be limitations in a format like we have had.\nThe public health situation being what it is means that we _must_ put on an event that's much more accessible to those who can't travel, and we hope that we can adapt the things we learn this year to our in-person event in years to come.\n","staticData":{}}
