{"body":"\n# About elm-conf\n\nelm-conf is a three-day, single-track conference for the Elm programming language community, now in its fifth year.\nThank you to everyone who helps make elm-conf a reality: speakers, attendees, the talk selection team, and our sponsors.\n\nSpecial thanks to [Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com), who gave us space and time to put on the conference for our first four years.\nIt wouldn't have been possible without them, and we encourage everyone to attend their conference as well.\nIf you like elm-conf, you'll probably like Strange Loop!\n\n## General Organizing Principles\n\n1. **A thriving community is built on diversity.** We encourage people from all backgrounds and walks of life to attend and speak. To ensure that everyone is included, we follow and enforce a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct).\n\n2. **We assume you're already interested in Elm.** \"Here's why you should care about Elm\" is a great topic, but is more appropriate for a general-interest conference.\n\n3. **We cannot have a good conference without good speakers.** We will take care of our speakers leading up to and during the conference and will make sure they have what they need to deliver their best talk. Speakers have the final say on their representation in published materials, on the website, and in their published talks.\n\n4. **elm-conf is for the community.** A conference can't exist without a healthy community. We will do our part by choosing our words carefully and kindly, and communicating early and often about difficulties.\n   \n## Organizers\n\nelm-conf is organized by:\n\n- Brian Hicks\n- Emma Cunningham\n- Grace Callahan\n\nContact the organizers by emailing [hey@elm-conf.com](mailto:hey@elm-conf.com)\n","staticData":{}}
